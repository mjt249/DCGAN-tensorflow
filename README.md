# Abstract: Signed Distance Function Based Generative Adversarial Network for 3D Shape Generation

 Shape representation is a crucial aspect in 3D shape learning. Recent advances in 3D shape learning rely on voxelized volumetric shape representation or rendered 2D views. While these methods have achieved some success in tasks such as classification and shape retrieval, there is much room for improvement in terms of generating visually pleasing results. In this paper, we make the case that signed distance function (SDF) is a more suitable representation for many aspects of 3D shape learning, and that deep 3D convolutional generative adversarial networks (GAN) can be utilized for learning in 3D SDF domain. More interestingly, we show that our neural network is capable of learning physical field properties in an unsupervised manner. For full paper, see SDF_GAN_Paper.pdf
